This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router v6 related to catch-all routes (`/*`). The issue arises when a catch-all route is defined after more specific routes, and it unexpectedly captures all routes, not just those that don't match other routes. This problem is solved by moving the catch-all route to the top of the route definitions.  The solution offers a clear and concise way to resolve this issue.
